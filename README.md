## Wins 
- Working with react, router and cypress efficiently and learning the concepts together while asking question and researching.  
- Working collaboratively to finish the project ahead of time 
- Having open communication that was reciproacted and taken into consideration as well as prompt communication.
- Being able to work together in a way that was productive and managable and also working solo and handling merge conflicts in a proper and easy manner.

## Challenges 
- Architecture was a challenge that we 
thoroughly researched and by the end of the project we had a much better understanding of how to structure our code. 
- Deployment gave us a hard time which turned out to be a super simple fix but it's worth noting that we did learn something from it. 
- User testing: Once we deployed we had a couple different users check the app on their phones to give us feedback on the user interface and experience. In doing this we discovered that we had a few things that needed adjusting for a better user experience, which included the sizing of the movie image and the text wrap on the movie overview text on the individual movie page. 

## Further development plans 
- Refactoring the architecture
